      <h1>Meet Nicky, Founder of Travel Tribe</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Nicky, co-founder of Wild & Free Zanzibar and proud
        “Mother of the Travel Tribe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel has always been in my blood—sometimes I like to
        say I’ve got jet fuel running through my veins. As a mom of
        two adventurous girls, I’m passionate about raising them
        with the same wild and free spirit that has shaped my own
        journey.</p>
      <p>
        After years of advocacy in the fight against human
        trafficking, I discovered a new way to make a difference: by
        creating safer travel experiences for women, families, and
        especially the next generation of daughters. Wild & Free
        Zanzibar, along side Wild and Free Travel Tribe, is more than a travel brand—it’s a movement to
        explore the world boldly, freely, and with peace of mind.

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>To empower solo female travelers with a greater sense of safety</li>
      <li>To build a global sisterhood that our daughters can grow into </li>
      <li>To ease the loneliness that often accompanies solo journeys</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We live in a vast and beautiful world filled with opportunity, but it also carries
real risks. While we cannot promise complete safety, we can equip women
and girls with knowledge, resources, and community—tools that help them
travel with confidence and keep them out of harm’s way.</p>
