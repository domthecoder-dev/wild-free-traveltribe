        <h1>“Wild & Free Travel Tribe is your Safety Mom on the road—supporting solo moms and young travelers with guidance, community, and peace of mind across Tanzania and South Africa.”</h1>
        <p>Wild & Free Travel Tribe is a unique safety and support service designed for solo female travelers, moms, and young adventurers exploring Tanzania and South Africa. More than just travel 
          tips, we offer real peace of mind—through live location sharing, check-ins, and a supportive global sisterhood. Whether you’re a mom traveling with kids, a student on a cultural exchange,
           or simply a woman exploring new destinations, Wild & Free gives you the tools, guidance, and community to travel boldly, safely, and with confidence.</p>
        <p>While our focus at Wild & Free Travel Tribe is SAFETY, it’s important to understand that we cannot guarantee protection. What we can do is be the trusted 
          person you share your live location with, along with your driver’s details or any relevant information about your whereabouts. This way, if something goes 
          wrong, someone knows where to look.</p>
        <p>We rely entirely on the information you choose to share with us. We are not a private security company—we don’t spy, track, or share your personal details
           with anyone. Our role is to provide guidance, support, and a neutral check-in when needed—especially in situations where your child or loved one may not respond.</p>
        <p>In the event that you go off the radar and your family or friends are looking for you, having this information could make all the difference. We’re here to help you 
          travel boldly, freely, and with peace of mind, knowing someone has your back.</p>
